# Programming
This repository holds my programming projects, listed in order of completion date. 

**Trajectory Optimization Project:** Low Thrust LEO to GEO (MATLAB)
- Strategized, optimized, and presented code that minimized satellite’s fuel consumption going from LEO to GEO orbits.  
- Developed knowledge on optimal control, optimal trajectory, troubleshooting techniques, aerospace, and optimization algorithms such as calculus of variations and steepest descent. 
- Communicated results of code, areas for improvement, and questions on the development to graduate peers.   

**Satellite Tracking/Orbital Observation MATLAB Code:** (MATLAB)
- Developed multiple MATLAB codes with various initial inputs of classical orbital elements to output final classical orbital elements and dynamic behavior of satellites from various ground tracking sites.  
- Learned, understood, and applied Kepler’s and Euler’s laws, coordinate changes from IJK to SEZ, and various orbital shapes 
- Developed, troubleshoot, and tested user-defined functions for finalized code 

**RenamingFiles:** (PYTHON)
This project came up while I was working at Anchor Engineering. In our design/analysis process, there was a mundane step where we had to copy preexisting templates and rename them to the current job number. This generally took a few minutes but many people did not want to rename the files leading to unorganized folders and files. Therefore, I created this .exe file using Python where all they have to do is run the .exe and the files will automatically be renamed with the job number. This project helped me learn more about the OS package and data structures such as for loops and if statements.
