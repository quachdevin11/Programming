# Programming
This repository holds my projects that got me into programming and demonstrates the power it has. 

Trajectory Optimization Project: Low Thrust LEO to GEO
Strategized, optimized, and presented code that minimized satellite’s fuel consumption going from LEO to GEO orbits.  
Developed knowledge on optimal control, optimal trajectory, troubleshooting techniques, aerospace, and optimization algorithms such as calculus of variations and steepest descent. 
Clearly communicated results of code, areas for improvement, and questions on the development to graduate peers.   

 

Satellite Tracking/Orbital Observation MATLAB Code 

Developed multiple MATLAB codes with various initial inputs of classical orbital elements to output final classical orbital elements and dynamic behavior of satellites from various ground tracking sites.  
Learned, understood, and applied Kepler’s and Euler’s laws, coordinate changes from IJK to SEZ, and various orbital shapes 
Developed, troubleshooted, and tested user defined functions for finalized code
